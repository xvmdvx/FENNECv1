# Changelog

## v0.3

- Fixed Bento Mode positioning so the sidebar displays correctly on Gmail and DB.

- Fixed a race condition where the "Family Tree" view failed to load if the
  background script queried the page before helper functions finished
  initializing.

  properly passing the selected state and order type to the injected script.

  obscured.
- Fixed diagnose overlay crash when the `escapeHtml` helper was missing by
  building the floating cards using DOM methods.
- Fixed issue lookup failing on Gmail when DB was open on a sandbox domain by
  only overriding the base URL when the sender tab belongs to `incfile.com`.

  pages by reattaching the sidebar listeners.
- Stored DB summaries now include the Quick Summary so Gmail Review Mode hides
  the other boxes correctly.

  orders load correctly.
- Further improved detection when the parent order link sits inside the

- Fixed a crash showing "Error loading summary" when the DB sidebar looked up
  billing details.
- Fixed parent order detection when multiple sections contain "Parent Order" so
  the Family Tree icon works on SB pages.
- Fixed detection when the Parent Order information only appears in the `#vcompany` tab.
- Fixed detection when the Parent Order line sits within a paragraph or list item
  inside the `#vcomp` tab.
- Fixed detection when the Parent Order link only shows digits inside the
  `#vcomp` tab so the Family Tree icon opens correctly.
- Simplified parent order lookup to only search within the `#vcomp` tab.
- Fixed missing parent order on SB miscellaneous orders when the label is not
  inside a `.form-group` container.

  elements with their text for easier debugging.

  when no parent ID is found.
- Fixed detection when the parent order number appears in a sibling element
  next to the label inside the `#vcomp` tab.
- Exposed the `getParentOrderId` and `diagnoseHoldOrders` helpers globally so the
  Family Tree icon works consistently.

  intact while loading.

  displayed below the Billing section in Gmail Review Mode.
