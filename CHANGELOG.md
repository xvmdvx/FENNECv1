# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
- Start of new changelog. Latest updates have been incorporated into the README.
- Fixed email order count in Fraud Review XRAY to read from the active email
  search tab rather than always using the DB order email.
- Prevented Fraud Review tab from regaining focus when EKATA finishes during
  XRAY. Now the flow proceeds directly to Adyen without interrupting the
  current tab.
- Queue View summary now shows totals from the downloaded CSV and flags orders
  marked as Possible Fraud.
- Fixed CSV totals reverting after Queue View; summary now remains until run again.
- CSV orders and summary now persist across page refreshes so the table does not
  revert to the initial search results until Queue View is executed again.
- Suppressed the DataTables Ajax warning on DB order search by loading the
  datatables patch at document start.
- DB Order Search sidebar now displays VIEW ALL, VIEW CURRENT and CLEAR buttons
  below the summary box. VIEW CURRENT summarizes the visible page while CLEAR
  resets stored CSV data.
- Fixed Gmail Review Mode XRAY button to launch the full flow without displaying
  the trial floater and restores focus to the originating email when completed.
- Fixed GM SB XRAY not opening Kount, Ekata and Adyen when the DB completion
  flag persisted.
- Fixed Gmail sidebar not showing Adyen DNA after XRAY finished due to session ID filter.
- Fixed Kount sidebar lacking styles in XRAY flow; now loads sidebar CSS.
- Sidebar header is now generated by a global function so all environments share the same layout.
- Quick Actions EMAILS option now opens a Gmail search instead of the DB email search.
- Fixed Review Mode sidebar not clearing after closing the email tab; session data now resets when leaving Gmail.
- Fixed Gmail sidebar leaving Kount info after closing the email; storage now fully resets.
- Fixed Gmail Review Mode showing old issue data when returning to Inbox or opening a new email; session storage now clears on pagehide.
- Fixed Gmail inbox not clearing stored order issues; the sidebar now resets when loading `#inbox`.
- Gmail email search now switches to the delegated account automatically before submitting the query.
- Fixed Gmail EMAIL SEARCH button leaving focus on search results and failing to build the sidebar summaries.
- Gmail EMAIL SEARCH now keeps the current email open so the sidebar remains visible until the message is closed.
- Issue box uploads disable the comment field; each file shows a rename field below its name and the action button reads **UPLOAD** or **CONVERT & UPLOAD** depending on file types.
- Fixed Gmail Review Mode sidebar disappearing after using EMAIL SEARCH; summaries now remain while the email is open.
