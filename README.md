# FENNEC (POO)

FENNEC (POO)'s principal function is injecting a SIDEBAR (SB) as a navigation companion that extracts information from relevant environments and displays it in a reordered manner to improve agents' productivity and reduce mental stress. Each environment has its unique layout depending on the type's necessities.

## Directory overview

The extension FENNEC (POO) lives in the `FENNEC/` folder. Key pieces include:

- `manifest.json` â€“ Manifest V3 configuration. The service worker is `core/background_email_search.js`.
- `core/` â€“ Shared helpers and the service worker.
  - `background_email_search.js` â€“ handles messaging, tab control and CORS removal for the local Mistral integration.
  - `utils.js` â€“ common utilities such as copying text and opening search tabs.
  - `sidebar.js` â€“ `Sidebar` class used to build the sidebar container.
  - `launcher.js` â€“ base `Launcher` class for environment scripts.
  - `messenger.js` â€“ helper for sending/receiving messages consistently.
  - `mistral_chat.js` â€“ chat widget used when Dev Mode is enabled.
- `environments/` â€“ Content scripts injected into specific sites:
  - `gmail/gmail_launcher.js` â€“ Gmail interface.
  - `db/db_launcher.js` â€“ Internal order pages.
  - `db/csv_hook.js` â€“ Captures CSV downloads in Order Search.
  - `db/table_inject.js` â€“ Injects new rows into the results table using jQuery.
  - `adyen/adyen_launcher.js` â€“ Adyen payment pages.
  - `txsos/tx_sos_launcher.js` â€“ Texas SOS filing site.
  - `usps/usps_launcher.js` â€“ USPS address verification.
- `styles/` â€“ Sidebar and options page stylesheets.
- `popup.html` and `popup.js` â€“ enable/disable the extension and open the options page.
- `options.html` and `options.js` â€“ persist user preferences such as sidebar width.
- `dictionary.txt` â€“ glossary of abbreviations used in the code and documentation.
- `CHANGELOG.md` â€“ lists new features and fixes.
- `README.md` â€“ this guide.

For historical changes refer to the **Changelog**. This document is reset everytime requested by the user, ensuring changes are now reflected on README, DICTIONARY, AGENTS, etc.

### Architecture

FENNEC (POO) follows a modular objectâ€‘oriented design.  All reusable classes live in the `core/` folder and are loaded by the service worker at `core/background_email_search.js`.  This worker acts as the central hub: it routes messages, opens or closes tabs and forwards requests to the local Ollama server.

The user interface is created by the `Sidebar` class while overlay panels (Diagnose, Update, Fraud Review, etc.) inherit from the `Floater` base class.  Each supported site provides its own launcherâ€”such as `gmail_launcher.js` or `db_launcher.js`â€”which extends the generic `Launcher` class to detect the page, extract data and inject the sidebar.  Communication between content scripts and the service worker is handled by the `Messenger` utility and common actions are provided by `utils.js`.  This structure keeps features isolated per environment while sharing a single backbone for consistent behavior across the extension.

ðŸ¤– FILE: Automator that opens and fills the SOS filing process.

GENERAL FEATURES:
- Clicking COMPANY NAME opens the SOS search, injects the name and hits search.
- Clicking the STATE ID in the sidebar opens the Coda Knowledge Base in a popup window covering about 70% of the page.
- RA and VA tags display in the COMPANY box. If the Registered Agent Service shows an expiration date in the past, the RA tag turns yellow and reads **EXPIRED**.
- A magnifier icon on the COMPANY box toggles a form with inputs to run SOS name or ID searches using custom parameters.
- ðŸ©º DIAGNOSE overlay lists hold orders from the Family Tree and now displays all child orders.
- When the sidebar is opened manually in Gmail or Adyen, it starts empty and only shows the action buttons. Order details appear after using SEARCH, DNA or XRAY.
- Visiting the Fraud tracker in DB automatically opens the sidebar in Review Mode and adds ðŸ©» XRAY icons next to each order number.

## Known limitations
- The scripts rely on the browser DOM provided by Chrome.
  
## Reference dictionary
- [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt) file explains the abbreviations and shorthand terms used throughout the extension.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of bug fixes. When adding new features, also update.


## Installation in Chrome
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder. The sidebar will then
   be available when visiting supported pages.
5. Open the extension **Options** from the menu or the Extensions page to set a default sidebar width and Review Mode. You can also toggle Review Mode directly from the extension popup. The popup now includes a **Reset Extension** button to clear saved settings and reload.


## Local Mistral integration
The Mistral Box sends prompts to a local [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) server.
Start Ollama so the API is reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate`.
Responses from that endpoint appear below the REFRESH button.
Requests are sent through the background script, which installs a
declarative rule to remove the `Origin` header so Ollama accepts them
without triggering CORS errors.
If the chat displays **Mistral service unavailable. Ensure Ollama is running.**
start or restart Ollama and click **Retry** in the chat box.

## Development

This repository now includes a minimal `package.json` to simplify future testing and build automation. The `npm test` command prints manual testing steps.

### Manual testing
Rest assured that all manual testing has been completed when reporting bugs or malfunctions.
The `manual-test.js` script prints a checklist for manually verifying the extension. For a complete checklist see [manual-test.js](manual-test.js). 

## Development notes

The `manual-test.js` script prints a checklist for manually verifying the extension. Terms used across this project are defined in `dictionary.txt`. When adding new features, update this README so the documentation stays current.
