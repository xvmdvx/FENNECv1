# FENNEC (POO)

FENNEC (POO)'s principal function is injecting a SIDEBAR (SB) as a navigation companion that extracts information from relevant environments and displays it in a reordered manner to improve agents' productivity and reduce mental stress. Each environment has its unique layout depending on the type's necessities.

## Directory overview

The extension FENNEC (POO) lives in the `FENNEC/` folder. Key pieces include:

- `manifest.json` – Manifest V3 configuration. The service worker is `core/background_email_search.js`.
- `core/` – Shared helpers and the service worker.
  - `background_email_search.js` – handles messaging, tab control and CORS removal for the local Mistral integration.
  - `utils.js` – common utilities such as copying text and opening search tabs.
  - `sidebar.js` – `Sidebar` class used to build the sidebar container.
  - `launcher.js` – base `Launcher` class for environment scripts.
  - `messenger.js` – helper for sending/receiving messages consistently.
  - `mistral_chat.js` – chat widget used when Dev Mode is enabled.
- `environments/` – Content scripts injected into specific sites:
  - `gmail/gmail_launcher.js` – Gmail interface.
  - `db/db_launcher.js` – Internal order pages.
  - `adyen/adyen_launcher.js` – Adyen payment pages.
  - `txsos/tx_sos_launcher.js` – Texas SOS filing site.
  - `usps/usps_launcher.js` – USPS address verification.
- `styles/` – Sidebar and options page stylesheets.
- `popup.html` and `popup.js` – enable/disable the extension and open the options page.
- `options.html` and `options.js` – persist user preferences such as sidebar width.
- `dictionary.txt` – glossary of abbreviations used in the code and documentation.
- `CHANGELOG.md` – lists new features and fixes.
- `README.md` – this guide.

For historical changes refer to the **Changelog**. This document is reset everytime requested by the user, ensuring changes are now reflected on README, DICTIONARY, AGENTS, etc.

### Architecture

FENNEC (POO) now uses an object-oriented structure. The `Sidebar` class builds the main container while specialized `Floater` subclasses manage overlays such as Diagnose, Update and Fraud Review. Each environment implements a launcher that extends the `Launcher` base class, and background logic is coordinated through `BackgroundController` with the help of the `Messenger` utility for consistent communication.

Eexperimental mode where upcoming features are tested before release.

      [🤖 FILE] and [🔄 REFRESH] buttons plus the Mistral Box appear at the bottom.
   GM:
      [🔄 REFRESH] button appears at the bottom.

ICONS/BUTTONS/FUNCTIONS:

📧 SEARCH (GM SB & GM SB REVIEW MODE): Opens tabs in background:
   1. Gmail Search with Order Number, Customer Email, Customer Name. 
   2. Order in DB

🗑 CLEAR TABS: Closes all tabs, except the one active, in current window.

🧹 CLEAR: Resets the sidebar to its INITIAL state depending on the enviroment.

🔄 Refresh: Updates sidebar information instantly with information extracted from the active tab.

🩻 XRAY: Runs SEARCH and Opens order payment information in Adyen and extracts relevant information from two tabs:
   1. Payment Details
   2. DNA one after the other and opens the Kount workflow page when available.
   After DNA loads the extension briefly opens the DB email search page until the order history appears,
   then focus returns to the Fraud tracker at the end.
   A KOUNT summary box appears below DNA after the data is extracted.
   
🤖 FILE: Automator that opens and fills the SOS filing process.

GENERAL FEATURES:
- Clicking COMPANY NAME opens the SOS search, injects the name and hits search.
- Clicking the STATE ID in the sidebar opens the Coda Knowledge Base in a popup window covering about 70% of the page.
- RA and VA tags display in the COMPANY box. If the Registered Agent Service shows an expiration date in the past, the RA tag turns yellow and reads **EXPIRED**.
- A magnifier icon on the COMPANY box toggles a form with inputs to run SOS name or ID searches using custom parameters.
- 🩺 DIAGNOSE overlay lists hold orders from the Family Tree and now displays all child orders.
- When the sidebar is opened manually in Gmail or Adyen, it starts empty and only shows the action buttons. Order details appear after using SEARCH, DNA or XRAY.
- Visiting the Fraud tracker in DB automatically opens the sidebar in Review Mode and adds 🩻 XRAY icons next to each order number.

### Session handling
FENNEC manages three session levels:
- **Tab session** – the default per-tab state with no order information shown.
- **Window session** – tabs in the same browser window share a session id so the sidebar stays in sync.
- **Flow session** – when the sidebar opens new tabs or windows, the current session id propagates to maintain continuity.
Opening a page outside an existing flow resets the sidebar to its initial view. The Gmail inbox never displays order details.

## Known limitations
- The scripts rely on the browser DOM provided by Chrome.
  
## Reference dictionary
- [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt) file explains the abbreviations and shorthand terms used throughout the extension.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of bug fixes. When adding new features, also update.


## Installation in Chrome
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder. The sidebar will then
   be available when visiting supported pages.
5. Open the extension **Options** from the menu or the Extensions page to set a default sidebar width and Review Mode. You can also toggle Review Mode directly from the extension popup. The popup now includes a **Reset Extension** button to clear saved settings and reload.


## Local Mistral integration
The Mistral Box sends prompts to a local [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) server.
Start Ollama so the API is reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate`.
Responses from that endpoint appear below the REFRESH button.
Requests are sent through the background script, which installs a
declarative rule to remove the `Origin` header so Ollama accepts them
without triggering CORS errors.
If the chat displays **Mistral service unavailable. Ensure Ollama is running.**
start or restart Ollama and click **Retry** in the chat box.

## Development

This repository now includes a minimal `package.json` to simplify future testing and build automation. The `npm test` command prints manual testing steps.

### Manual testing
Rest assured that all manual testing has been completed when reporting bugs or malfunctions.
The `manual-test.js` script prints a checklist for manually verifying the extension. For a complete checklist see [manual-test.js](manual-test.js). 

## Development notes

The `manual-test.js` script prints a checklist for manually verifying the extension. Terms used across this project are defined in `dictionary.txt`. When adding new features, update this README so the documentation stays current.
