# FENNEC File Popup Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a popup window functionality for all "OPEN" buttons in the FENNEC extension that opens files in a popup window covering 70% of the original space, as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Utility Function (`core/utils.js`)
Added `openFileInPopup()` function that:
- Calculates 70% of the current window dimensions
- Centers the popup on the screen
- Creates a popup window with specific features:
  - Scrollbars enabled
  - Resizable
  - No toolbar, menubar, location bar, or status bar
  - Automatic focus
- Includes fallback to regular `window.open()` if popup is blocked
- Added to global scope as `window.openFileInPopup`

### 2. Environment Updates
Updated all environment launchers to use the new popup function:

#### DB Launcher (`environments/db/db_launcher.js`)
- Updated 2 instances of `.int-open` button event listeners
- Changed from `window.open(u, '_blank')` to `openFileInPopup(u)`

#### Gmail Launcher (`environments/gmail/gmail_launcher.js`)
- Updated 2 instances of `.int-open` button event listeners
- Changed from `bg.openOrReuseTab({ url: u, active: false })` to `openFileInPopup(u)`
- Updated global click handler for INT STORAGE OPEN buttons

#### Adyen Launcher (`environments/adyen/adyen_launcher.js`)
- Updated 1 instance of `.int-open` button event listener
- Changed from `window.open(u, '_blank')` to `openFileInPopup(u)`

#### Kount Launcher (`environments/kount/kount_launcher.js`)
- Updated 1 instance of `.int-open` button event listener
- Changed from `window.open(u, '_blank')` to `openFileInPopup(u)`

### 3. Test File
Created `test_popup.html` for testing the popup functionality with various URLs.

## Technical Details

### Popup Window Features
- **Size**: 70% of current window width and height
- **Position**: Centered on screen
- **Window Features**:
  - `scrollbars=yes` - Enables scrollbars for content overflow
  - `resizable=yes` - Allows user to resize the popup
  - `toolbar=no` - Hides browser toolbar
  - `menubar=no` - Hides browser menubar
  - `location=no` - Hides address bar
  - `status=no` - Hides status bar

### Fallback Behavior
If popup blocking is enabled or the popup fails to open:
- Logs an error message
- Falls back to regular `window.open(url, '_blank')`

### Browser Compatibility
The implementation uses standard `window.open()` API which is supported by all modern browsers.

## Usage
The popup functionality is automatically applied to all "OPEN" buttons in the INT STORAGE sections across all environments (DB, Gmail, Adyen, Kount). No additional configuration is required.

## Testing
Use `test_popup.html` to verify the popup functionality works correctly:
1. Open the test file in a browser
2. Click any of the test buttons
3. Verify the popup opens with 70% size and proper positioning
4. Test resizing and scrolling functionality

## Files Modified
1. `core/utils.js` - Added `openFileInPopup()` function
2. `environments/db/db_launcher.js` - Updated OPEN button handlers
3. `environments/gmail/gmail_launcher.js` - Updated OPEN button handlers
4. `environments/adyen/adyen_launcher.js` - Updated OPEN button handlers
5. `environments/kount/kount_launcher.js` - Updated OPEN button handlers
6. `test_popup.html` - Created test file for verification

## Implementation Status
âœ… **COMPLETED** - All OPEN buttons in INT STORAGE sections now open files in popup windows covering 70% of the original space across all environments and modes.
