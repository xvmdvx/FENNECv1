# FENNEC (BETA)

FENNEC's principal function is injecting a SIDEBAR (SB) as a navigation companion that extracts information from relevant environments and displays it in a reordered manner to improve agents' productivity and reduce mental stress. Each environment has its unique layout depending on the type's necessities.

## Features

SIDEBAR HEADER:
It remains constant throughout all layouts, unless an IMPORTANT restriction is added.
   Left: Hamburger Icon/Menu. This floater contains QUICK ACTIONS.
   Center: Icon, App name and version in parentheses.
   Right: Icon for clean window action. Close SB button.

CLASSIC MODE:
This is the default and most basic layout for the sidebar. It appears in Gmail (GM) and DB. Experimental features are hidden unless Dev Mode is enabled.

## Reference dictionary
- [dictionary.txt](dictionary.txt) file explains the abbreviations and shorthand terms used throughout the extension.
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a detailed list of bug fixes. When adding new features, also update.


## Installation in Chrome
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top right).
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the project folder. The sidebar will then
   be available when visiting supported pages.
5. Open the extension **Options** from the menu or the Extensions page to set a default sidebar width and Review Mode.


## Local Mistral integration
The Mistral Box sends prompts to a local [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) server.
Start Ollama so the API is reachable at `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate`.
Responses from that endpoint appear below the REFRESH button.
Requests are sent through the background script, which installs a
declarative rule to remove the `Origin` header so Ollama accepts them
without triggering CORS errors.
If the chat displays **Mistral service unavailable. Ensure Ollama is running.**
start or restart Ollama and click **Retry** in the chat box.
