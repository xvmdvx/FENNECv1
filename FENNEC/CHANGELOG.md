# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The payment step logs the dropdown selector and value before clicking **Continue** so you can confirm **Client Account** is selected.
- Diagnose overlay now supports Reinstatement orders and detects amendments or reinstatements in review.
- Replaced `form.submit()` fallback with a submit event to mimic real clicks.
- Added a brief delay after selecting the payment type so the page registers **Client Account** reliably.
- Fixed the Mistral chat box disappearing after loading the order summary.
- The Mistral Box now sends prompts to a local Ollama server at
  `http://127.0.0.1:11434/api/generate`.
- Requests route through the background script to avoid CORS errors when
  communicating with the local server.
- Friendly error message now appears if the Mistral service is unavailable and
  includes a **Retry** button.
- The background script strips the `Origin` header so the local server accepts
  Mistral requests without returning **403**.

- Added Dev Mode. The Mistral chat box, FILE and REFRESH buttons now appear only when Dev Mode is enabled.
- Added quick resolve field below the Issue summary in Gmail.
- Quick resolve button now shows **COMMENT** when the issue is already resolved
  and automatically returns focus to Gmail with a success message.

- Quick resolve now reuses an existing DB tab when available and displays the
  completion message inside the Gmail sidebar instead of using a popup.

- Quick Summary no longer auto-expands on Annual Report orders and the
  Family Tree panel loads automatically.

  inside the `#vcomp` tab.
